# TODO List for Python MetaTrader Terminal Project

## Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Set up a Django project for the REST API.
2. Configure Docker to run MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 terminals.
3. Create Dockerfiles for both MetaTrader terminals and the Django application.
4. Set up a Docker Compose file to manage the containers.

## Phase 2: Authentication
1. Create Django models for MT4 and MT5 accounts.
2. Implement REST API endpoints for account authentication.
   - Endpoint to authenticate and add a new MT4/MT5 account.
   - Endpoint to list authenticated accounts.
3. Implement authentication logic to verify MT4/MT5 credentials.

## Phase 3: Trade Data Handling
1. Design and implement API endpoints to fetch trade data.
   - Endpoint to fetch current trades from the first available terminal.
   - Endpoint to place a new trade.
2. Implement logic to distribute tasks across multiple terminals.
3. Ensure thread safety and concurrency handling in task distribution.

## Phase 4: Testing and Documentation
1. Write unit and integration tests for all endpoints.
2. Document API endpoints and usage in `README.md`.
3. Ensure all services are properly containerized and can be deployed using Docker Compose.

## Phase 5: Deployment
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
2. Deploy the application to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement logging and monitoring for the API and terminals.
2. Add support for additional trading platforms if needed.
3. Optimize performance and scalability.
